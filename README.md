# Factorial

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial of n also equals the product of n with the next smaller factorial:

n ! = n × ( n − 1 ) × ( n − 2 ) × ( n − 3 ) × ⋯ × 3 × 2 × 1 = n × ( n − 1 ) !

For example,
5 ! = 5 × 4 ! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.

# Recursion

In computer science, recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. 
Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. 
The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science.
